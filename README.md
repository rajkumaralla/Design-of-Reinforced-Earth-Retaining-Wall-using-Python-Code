# Design-of-Reinforced-Earth-Retaining-Wall-using-Python-Code
Design of reinforced earth wall is performed using Python code as per guidelines of BS 8006-
2010 (code of practice for strengthened /reinforced soil and other fills) for dry horizontal 
cohesionless backfill for Dead load+Live load condition & Dead load+Live load+Horizontal & 
Vertical line load condition. The code will take input parameters such as soil properties, wall 
geometry, and loads, and will output the reinforcement requirements & factor of safety against 
rupture and pullout resistance. The developed code will be validated against existing design 
examples and will provide a more efficient and accurate design process compared to traditional 
manual methods.
